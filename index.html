            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Viswanathan Anand was born on 11 December 1969 in an Iyer family at Mayiladuthurai, Tamil Nadu, India[11][12] where he grew up.[13] His father Krishnamurthy Viswanathan, a retired general manager of Southern Railways, had studied in Jamalpur, Bihar, and his mother Sushila was a housewife, chess aficionado and an influential socialite.
                Anand is the youngest of 3 children. He is 11 years younger than his sister and 13 years younger than his brother. His elder brother, Shivakumar, is a manager at Crompton Greaves in India and his elder sister, Anuradha, is a professor in the United States at the University of Michigan.
                Anand learned chess from age six from his mother Sushila, but learned the intricacies of the game in Manila where he lived with his parents in 1978 up to the '80s while his father was contracted as a consultant by the Philippine National Railways.
                Anand was educated at Don Bosco Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Egmore, Chennai and holds a degree of Bachelor of Commerce from Loyola College, Chennai.

            <h2>Personal Life</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Anand married Aruna in 1996 and has a son, Akhil, born on 9 April 2011, and is named in the traditional patronymic way Anand Akhil.
                In August 2010, Anand joined the board of directors of Olympic Gold Quest, a foundation for promoting and supporting India's elite sportspersons and potential young talent.[21][22][23] On 24 December 2010, Anand was the guest of honour on the grounds of Gujarat University, where 20,486 players created a new world record of simultaneous chess play at a single venue.
                Anand has been regarded as an unassuming person with a reputation for refraining from political and psychological ploys and instead focusing on his game. This has made him a well-liked figure throughout the chess world for two decades, evidenced by the fact that Garry Kasparov, Vladimir Kramnik, and Magnus Carlsen, of whom the first two were rivals for the World Championship throughout Anand's career, each aided him in his preparations for the World Chess Championship 2010. Anand is sometimes known as the "Tiger of Madras".
                Anand was denied an honorary doctorate from University of Hyderabad because of confusion over his citizenship status; however, later Kapil Sibal, India's Minister of Human Resource Development apologised and said "There is no issue on the matter as Anand has agreed to accept the degree at a convenient time depending on his availability".[30] According to The Hindu, Anand finally declined to accept the doctorate.
